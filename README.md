# merry-christmas -  A christmas card for 2013

This is a personal project of mine to create a webapp companion for the Christmas cards
I am sending out in 2013. Recipeients will be mailed a christmas card with a unique 4
color combination on the front. Inside of each card will be a link to this webapp hosted
on a remote heroku repository - "merry-christmas.herokuapp.com". On that website,
recipients may enter their unique 4 color combination and a custom christmas card will
be pulled up for them on the webpage.


## design

This webapp uses the angular-seed app. This is my first webapp using AngularJS.
